# My Portfolio Showcase Website
Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js.
## Reason for tech stack
I wanted minimal tech stack since this site is meant to be statically served.
Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js allows me to write CSS and Javascript in HTML files itself, 
reducing code bloat and allowing me to serve these files FAST. This saves me compute
allowing me to use free hosting services :)
